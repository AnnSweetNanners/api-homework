Section 5- API Homework

## Required Dependencies
1. Python/OS
2. Pandas libraries
3. Requests library
4. Dotenv
5. Alpaca Trade API
6. MC Forecast Tools

## Code Operation
Section 1 is a personal finance planner for a credit union. It uses API's to fetch daily prices for a portfolio containing cryptocurrencies and ETF's. It evaluates the client's current holdings against a recommended savings amount.

Section 2 uses Monte Carlo scenarios to project possible returns over 30 years for a stock portfolio weighted with 40% bonds and 60% ETF's using various investment amounts.

## Optional Activity
The optional activity made very simple assumptions, and did not account for costs in retirement. It assumed $1 million was required for retirement.  It also assumes the maximum amount will be reached. In testing values, I determined a higher weight of stocks ultimately led to higher returns. Additionally, longer timeframes allows the investor to reach goals more quickly with a lower initial investment. This is synonomous with real world examples, greater risk = greater return.
